"""Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

Example 1:

Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]

Example 2:

Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Constraints:

    0 <= strs.length < 100
    0 <= strs[i].length < 200
    strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.
